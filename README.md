Attempt to create simple Event Sourced system without any frameworks

Idea will be to keep record of the events for the games with abilty to rebuild the system

Events will be kept in a plain text file

I'll try using "Event Storming" to come up with what

The Process Manager will come in to score the Game and assign Points

Aggregates:
Game
GamePoints
UserPoints
LeaderBoard

ProcessManagers:
GameScorer
